A set of implemented alogorithms describes in the Algorithms II at Coursera.

## 2. Seam Carving

Seam carving is a content-aware technique to resize the image. The algorithms reduces 
the size of the image by one pixel of height or width at a time. The algorithms preserves
the most interesting features, such the set of objects on the pictures, and the aspect ratio.
