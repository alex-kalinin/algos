A set of implemented alogorithms describes in the Algorithms II at Coursera.

### 2. Seam Carving

Seam carving is a content-aware technique to resize the image. It reduces 
the size of the image by one pixel of height or width at a time. The algorithms 
preserves interesting features on the image, such the set of objects or the 
aspect ratio.
